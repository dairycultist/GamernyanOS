Find one specific (popular) architecture that I can emulated with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and focus on that. First goal: Run assembly code that outputs _something_.

gotta link stuff together idk

- [startup/entrypoint script](https://github.com/memtest86plus/memtest86plus/blob/main/boot/x86/startup64.S) written in assembly (.S) that sets up the stack (and maybe some other stuff) and calls the C main function.
- [C code](https://github.com/memtest86plus/memtest86plus/blob/main/app/main.c)!!
